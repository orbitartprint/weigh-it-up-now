                Your daily calorie needs are not a fixed number; they're dynamic and depend on how your body uses energy. Our calculator provides you with two crucial metrics to understand your metabolism and energy expenditure:
              </p>
              
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p><strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):</strong> This is the minimum number of calories your body needs to perform basic, life-sustaining functions at rest. Think of it as the energy required to breathe, circulate blood, regulate body temperature, and grow cells â€“ even when you're sleeping. It's the engine running in neutral.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):</strong> This represents the total number of calories your body burns in a 24-hour period. It includes your BMR plus the calories burned through all your daily activities, from walking to exercising, digesting food, and even thinking. It's your BMR plus your activity level.</p>
              </div>
              
              <p>
                Understanding the difference between BMR and TDEE is fundamental for any weight management strategy, whether your goal is to lose, maintain, or gain weight. Your BMR is a baseline, while your TDEE reflects your actual daily energy needs based on your lifestyle.

            Key Factors Influencing Your Calorie Needs
          </AccordionTrigger>

              <p>
                Your daily calorie requirements are unique, shaped by a variety of individual characteristics and lifestyle choices. Our calculator takes these into account to provide a personalized estimate. Here are the primary factors that play a significant role:
              </p>
              
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Metabolism tends to slow down with age. As you get older, your BMR typically decreases, meaning you need fewer calories to maintain your weight.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Men generally have higher calorie needs than women due to a larger average body size and higher muscle mass, which burns more calories at rest.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Body Composition (Muscle Mass):</strong> Muscle tissue is metabolically more active than fat tissue. Individuals with a higher percentage of muscle mass will burn more calories at rest, thus having a higher BMR and TDEE.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Activity Level:</strong> This is one of the most significant variables. Someone with a sedentary lifestyle will have a much lower TDEE than an athlete training daily. The more physically active you are, the more calories you burn.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Height and Weight:</strong> Taller and heavier individuals generally have a larger surface area and more tissue to maintain, leading to higher calorie needs.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Genetics & Hormones:</strong> Individual genetic makeup can influence metabolic rate, while hormonal imbalances (e.g., thyroid issues) can also significantly impact how your body uses energy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Even factors like climate (living in very cold or hot environments) can slightly alter calorie expenditure.</p>

            Calorie Balance: The Foundation of Weight Management

                Once you know your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), you can strategically adjust your calorie intake to achieve your weight goals. The principle is simple: energy balance.
              </p>
              
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p><strong>For Weight Loss (Calorie Deficit):</strong> To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your TDEE. This creates a calorie deficit, forcing your body to use stored energy (fat) for fuel. Aim for a moderate deficit (e.g., 500 calories per day) for sustainable and healthy weight loss (typically 1-2 pounds or 0.5-1 kg per week).</p>
                
                <p><strong>For Weight Maintenance (Calorie Balance):</strong> To maintain your current weight, your daily calorie intake should roughly match your TDEE. This keeps your energy input and output in equilibrium.</p>
                
                <p><strong>For Weight Gain (Calorie Surplus):</strong> To gain weight, particularly muscle mass, you need to consume more calories than your TDEE. This calorie surplus provides the extra energy needed for tissue growth. This should ideally be combined with strength training.</p>
              </div>
              
              <p>
                Remember, the quality of your calories matters just as much as the quantity. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) to fuel your body efficiently.

                Understanding your daily calorie needs is the first step; implementing this knowledge into your routine is the next. Here are some sustainable habits and practical tips for effective calorie management:
              </p>
              
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p><strong>Prioritize Whole Foods:</strong> Opt for unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. They are typically more nutrient-dense and promote satiety.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mindful Eating:</strong> Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly, savor your food, and avoid distractions. This can help you recognize when you've had enough.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Hydration is Key:</strong> Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Understand Macronutrients:</strong> Learn about the roles of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Proteins are particularly important for satiety and muscle preservation, especially during weight loss.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Familiarize yourself with appropriate portion sizes. Using smaller plates or measuring cups can be helpful.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cook at Home:</strong> Preparing your own meals gives you full control over ingredients and calorie content.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Meal prepping and planning snacks can prevent impulsive, unhealthy food choices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Be Patient & Consistent:</strong> Sustainable weight management is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on consistent healthy habits rather than quick fixes.</p>
